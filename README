this is just my personal emacs setup, 10 years in the making.

# Building emacs on ubuntu-ish linux

$ sudo apt install libgccjit-12-dev
$ export CC="gcc-12"

For doom-modeline, need to run:

    M-x nerd-icons-install-fonts

Notes:

for helm-ag, during the results:
- C-c C-e to "edit results", then do whatever you want in that buffer, then C-c C-c to commit all results!
- C-x C-s to "save results" to a buffer, then RET on a line to visit it in other window
- C-x c b revives the last helm session if you accidentally quit

To explore:
- more helm-projectile commands that seem useful


# Install Notes:

see install.md


### not sure if this stuff still applies

- `brew install global --with-pygments --with-ctags`
- pip install pygments

$ defaults write org.gnu.Emacs AppleFontSmoothing -int 0
