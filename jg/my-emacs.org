* write new buffer switcher because they all suck
** started...
* fix elscreen-bg :(
* switch copy/paste/undo to use command (meta) instead of control
** but not "cut" because M-x is special, and I use C-k/M-k instead anyway
* consider changing page up/down, center screen, maybe others for easier compat with god-mode
* M-p is all wonky... (sometimes?)...
** trying drag-stuff to fix
